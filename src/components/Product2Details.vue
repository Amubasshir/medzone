        Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women
        in the United States. Each year, over 220,000 people are diagnosed with
        lung cancer and over 150,000 people die from the disease.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm font-semibold pb-5">
        There are a number of factors that contribute to lung cancer, including
        smoking, exposure to secondhand smoke, and air pollution. However, even
        people who have never smoked or been exposed to secondhand smoke can
        develop lung cancer.

      <p class="text-xs font-normal pb-5">
        Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and deadliest forms of
        cancer worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, it is
        responsible for the highest number of cancer-related deaths each year.
        However, amidst the challenges, there is hope as medical researchers,
        organizations, and healthcare professionals are tirelessly working to
        advance treatment options, improve survival rates, and ultimately bring
        us closer to finding a cure for lung cancer. In this blog, we will
        explore some of the remarkable initiatives and advancements in the fight
        against lung cancer.

            Raising awareness about the risk factors associated with lung cancer
            is crucial in ensuring early detection and timely intervention.
            Organizations like the American Lung Association and various cancer
            societies worldwide have been actively involved in spreading
            awareness about the importance of smoking cessation, the dangers of
            secondhand smoke, and encouraging high-risk individuals to undergo
            lung cancer screening. By catching lung cancer at an early stage,
            the chances of successful treatment and improved outcomes are
            significantly enhanced.

        advanced lung cancer. By blocking the inhibitory signals in the immune
        system, these drugs help unleash the body's natural defense mechanisms
        to target and destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy has shown durable
        responses and improved survival rates, offering renewed hope for
